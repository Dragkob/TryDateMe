# TryDateMe
A browser extension that restores the creation and publish dates of TryHackMe rooms.

---

## 📌 Overview
TryDateMe is a lightweight, privacy‑friendly extension that adds back the **creation date** and **publish date** information to TryHackMe room pages. This data used to be visible but is no longer shown on the platform. TryDateMe brings it back.

The project is **source‑available**, openly developed, and community‑driven - but with strict usage terms (see License).

---

## ✨ Features
- ✔️ Automatically detects TryHackMe room pages
- ✔️ Extracts creation & publication dates
- ✔️ Displays them in a clean, native‑looking UI
- ✔️ Zero data collection
- ✔️ Lightweight and fast
- ✔️ Fully client‑side
- ✔️ Does not manipulate/modify the website/page in any way, shape or form.

## 🛠 Installation
### **Chrome / Edge / Brave / Chromium Browsers**

2. Go to: `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.

## 🧩 How It Works
TryDateMe analyzes the structure and API responses of TryHackMe room pages to detect metadata related to:
- Creation date
- Publish date

The extension **does not** send requests to third‑party servers. Everything happens locally.
